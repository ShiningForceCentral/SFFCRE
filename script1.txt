[94]What are you saying, Max?<line>If that's the case, it's time to finish me, don't you think?<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[95]Too bad I'm not the same old Mishaela you defeated before!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[96]Mistress Mishaela, I am here!<line>You can always rely on Lynx.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[97]Leave them to me!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[98]So, Max, it seems that you're here to stop us from fulfilling our dream.<delay 03><delay 01><end>

[9A]Do as you wish, Lynx.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[9B]Well, Shining Force!<line>Show me what you've got!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[9C]Ridion, we can't let Mishaela escape!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[9D]Adam, take Mead and the others and go after Mishaela!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[9E]<end> ; continues 9D
[9F]Understood, Master Max.<line>We'll chase after Mishaela.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A0]Mead, Paige, Sonette, let's go. Follow me!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A1]Right!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A2]Ridion, you sneak up behind Lynx.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A3]Okay Max!<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A4]They've gone after Mistress Mishaela?<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A5]I should get to her side quickly.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A6]Max fights well, however...<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A7]Pity I can't stay... I must return to Mistress Mishaela.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A8]Hold it, Lynx! You'll have to get past me first.<delay 03><delay 01><end>
[A9]I'll knock you down and wipe the floor with you, Devil!<delay 03><delay 01><end>

; Chapter 1: The Ancient Shrine, a New Journey Begins

[C8]The Shining Force fought a long battle at the ancient temple on the continent of Parmecia.<wait more><end>
[C9]Adam was damaged, and so they returned to the port town of Hassan to repair him...<wait><end>

[CA]How are you feeling, Adam?<line>Are the repairs working, I wonder?<wait><end>
[CB]It's hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to fight anymore.<wait more><end>
[CC]The others will be able to fight though, they're strong enough.<line>We should set out to find Max as soon as possible.<wait><end>
[CD]If you think it's necessary Adam, set up a pursuing party.<wait><end>
[CE]Indeed. I must protect Master Max, and prevent the entire world from being destroyed!<wait more><end>
[CF]For that reason, we should leave here and try to pick up his trail.<line>Don't worry though, we'll be back.<wait><end>
[D0]Adam should be doing fine now.<wait more><end>
[D1]When we brought him here to Hassan, I was worried he might never return to normal.<wait><end>
[D2]There's no need to worry, Mead. There's a self-repairing mechanism inside me.<wait more><end>
[D3]I may not be completely repaired yet, but I'm not about to become a useless lump of metal!<wait><end>
[D4]Nonetheless, we'll still worry a little.<line>Adam is delicate, unlike Mead!<wait><end>
[D5]That's right, Paige. Who would have imagined how Adam managed to recover?!<wait more><end>
[D6]For an apprentice mage like Hawel, this will be the sight of a lifetime!<wait><end>
[D7]What are you saying about me this time, Sonette?<wait><end>
[D8]Do you really think that I'm just some useless academic?<wait more><end>
[D9]I've already taught you so much. What a waste of time! <wait><end>
[DA]Just kidding, just kidding!<line>I've often had to depend on you and your experience, Hawel.<wait><end>
[DB]Okay, is everybody here?<line>Well, let's journey to the ancient temple to see what devils we must face!<wait><end>
[DC]Just a minute!<line>Shouldn't Knuckles be going with us?<wait><end>
[DD]That lazybones must have slept in again. He's really let Max down this time, he doesn't deserve to come with us.<wait more><end>
[DE]He's always late, and we always have to wait for him. We'll be waiting all day for him to wake up and get here!<wait><end>
[DF]That's right. There's no reason to let him delay us.<line>When he comes out, he can join us. Let's go now.<wait><end>
[E0]Oh dear! Knuckles, what shall we do with you!<line>If he shows up, I'll tell him you've already left.<wait><end>
[E1]Thank you. We couldn't ask for more.<wait><end>
[E2]Well then, Elder, our group should leave for the Ancient temple now. We'll return soon.<wait><end>
[E3]I'll be here waiting for you.<wait><end>
[E4]Grandpa, could <lookup name 00> please have a word with you?<wait><end>
[E5]Alright.<line>Wait inside, I'll be there in a moment.<wait><end>
[E6]<lookup name 00> became lost on his journey and came to Hassan by coincidence.<wait more><end>
[E7]I believe <lookup name 00> has something to tell Adam, too...<wait more><end>
[E8]...but I suppose he will have to wait until you return.<wait><end>
[E9]Well then....<line>Let's go to the ancient temple!<wait><end>
[EA]Hey! Wait up!<line>I'm all set to come along and do my best!<wait><end>
[EB]Knuckles, it's you!<line>What in the world were you thinking, arriving so late?!<wait more><end>
[EC]If you hadn't got here in time, we'd be setting off for the ancient temple without you!<wait><end>
[ED]Ha ha!<line>Sorry, sorry!<wait more><end>
[EE]I slept in late... then rushed to get ready!<line>I'm here because I know how important this is.<wait><end>
[EF]Come along then, it's time to depart.<wait><end>
[F0]Well everyone, let's go!<wait><end>

; Chapter 1, Battle 01

[F1]So Adam and his companions headed for the ancient temple to search for Max's trail, however...<wait><end>

[F2]This...<line>Is this it?<wait><end>
[F3]It is!<line>This is the Caravan...<line>It's said to be a very convenient means of transportation.<wait><end>
[F4]I... I don't understand!<line>How do you get this thing to move?<line>If we could only work out how to get inside...<wait><end>
[F5]Oh well, that woman said it's okay to break it if we can't make it work.<end>
[F6]He's going to damage that ancient relic!<wait><end>
[F7]Someone just had to come and spoil this...<line>We'll abandon the caravan for now. Let's get out of here!<wait more><end>
[F8]Hey, you!<line>A thief like me is skilled enough to escape. Men, why don't you keep them company?<wait><end>
[F9]The enemy is coming!<wait><end>
[FA]Adam, you can't fight, but we can!<wait><end>
[FB]Understood. Well then Mead, please lead them!<wait><end>

[FC]What?!<line>My men can't have been defeated!<wait more><end>
[FD]I think now's the time for a hasty exit.<wait><end>
[FE]I suppose you must be one of Mishaela's minions, since you're here at the ancient temple trying to damage things.<wait more><end>
[FF]We can't let you go free until we have decided there is good reason to do so.<wait><end>
