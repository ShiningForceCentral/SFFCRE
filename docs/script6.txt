; Chapter 4, Battle 20 (continued)

[00]A.... Adam...<wait><end>
[01]I didn't expect the new Shining Force to become so dependable!<wait><end>
[02]Master Max...<wait more><end>
[03]<party leader> has guided us so far.<wait><end>
[04]So, it was you...<wait more><end>
[05]I'm ashamed to say they put that mask on me when I was defeated in a fight with Lynx.<wait more><end>
[06]Curses! It can't be that I had the same fate as my brother, Kane!<line>At least we've put an end to it now.<wait><end>
[07]How could this happen to both Max and Kane...<wait><end>
[08]...nevertheless, you've skilfully made it this far.<wait more><end>
[09]I was afraid, but thanks to you it seems like we'll be able to go home.<wait><end>
[0A]With that much power, <party leader>, perhaps we really can stop the Devil's revival.<wait more><end>
[0B]<party leader>, may I too join the new Shining Force?<wait><end>
[0C]That will reassure the group, <party leader>.<line>Well, we should make haste and move on.<wait><end>

; Chapter 4, Battle 21

[0D]This is the place of Lord Darksol's revival...<wait><end>
[0E]Soon his revival will be completed.<wait more><end>
[0F]At that time, anyone who stands in his way will be powerless against him!<wait more><end>
[10]Until then, <party leader> and his force must not be allowed anywhere near Lord Darksol.<wait><end>
[11]Mistress Mishaela, even if Max is defeated, those guys pose no threat for you.<wait><end>
[12]<end> ; continues 11
[13]Well, I won't be defeated!<wait more><end>
[14]But, I think <party leader> will give us more trouble than Max did.<wait more><end>
[15]If by some chance they make it here, you must fight with all your strength!<wait><end>
[16]<party leader> being more troublesome than Max...?<wait><end>
[17]You should not take <party leader> so lightly. He's a talented man, and will require extra attention when we deal with him...<wait><end>
[18]Don't think you know <party leader> so well, Mishaela!<wait><end>
[19]It can't be...!<line>How did those guys get here?!<wait><end>
[1A]Thanks to <party leader>, I've been able to return to my old self.<wait more><end>
[1B]I'm sure you don't see how sweet <party leader> is!<wait><end>
[1C]*guffaws*<line>Well, well, well... isn't this a surprise?!<line>It seems there's something you don't know about <party leader> yet, Max.<wait more><end>
[1D]20 years ago a prophet in Manarina gave your brother Kane a prediction...<wait><end>
[1E]What?!<wait><end>
[1F]That prediction spoke of our reviving Lord Darksol, at this very place.<wait more><end>
[20]Kane didn't like the thought of that. He had a son, and sent him away to defeat Lord Darksol.<wait more><end>
[21]...<delay 01><line>and that son was...<delay 02> <party leader>!<wait><end>
[22]What the...?!<wait><end>
[23]Kane raised his son to lead a Shining Force, just like you - his brother - led the Shining Force.<wait more><end>
[24]His son was to follow in your footsteps.<wait><end>
[25]<party leader>, you...<wait more><end>
[26]...are my older brother's son?!<wait><end>
[27]I found out about this through Hassan's Elder, and I was surprised too!<wait more><end>
[28]Such a thing just can't be, can it?!<wait><end>
[29]Lord Darksol's revival is almost complete! Oh ho ho ho!<wait more><end>
[2A]This time, without a doubt, you fools shall not hinder the realisation of our great dream!<wait><end>
[2B]<end> ; continues 2A
[2C]Mishaela, you can't do that!<wait more><end>
[2D]I can't allow you to use Lord Zeon's power in the revival of Darksol.<wait><end>
[2E]W... who's that?!<wait><end>
[2F]Y... you're Odd Eye!<wait more><end>
[30]You're a devil, just like me. How could you have sided with those guys?<wait more><end>
[31]You can try to hinder us all you like, but it will do no good.<line>I'll risk my life to see Lord Darksol revive completely!<wait><end>
[32]Mishaela, you need to wake up!<line>Why are you going so far?<wait more><end>
[33]You're just dazzled by Darksol's illusions.<wait more><end>
[34]You're putting your life on the line here... will that do you any good?!<wait><end>
[35]We must protect Lord Darksol's dear child, Mephisto!<wait more><end>
[36]Compared with that goal, my life isn't important.<wait><end>
[37]<party leader>! If it's like this, one man alone cannot defeat Mishaela.<wait more><end>
[38]Darksol's revival must be stopped! I'll join your party.<wait><end>
[39]Odd Eye the Devil has joined the Force.<wait><end>

[3A]It seems I've been defeated, my magical powers are exhausted...<wait more><end>
[3B]I must cast away this life for...<delay 02><line>At least...<wait more><end>
[3C]I'll sacrifice myself for you, Lord Darksol!<wait><end>
[3D]Mishaela sacrificed her life for Darksol's revival...<wait><end>
[3E]Mishaela's life has completed the revival of my powers.<wait more><end>
[3F]Now, take a good look at the true form of Darksol, King of the Devils!<wait><end>

; Chapter 4, Battle 22

[40]L...look over there everyone! Darksol seems to have completed his revival.<wait more><end>
[41]Prepare yourselves to defeat him!<wait><end>

[42]It can't be!<line>Mere mortals can't have defeated me like this!<wait more><end>
[43]My revival should have been completed...<line>How...?<wait more><end>
[44]Something has been holding back my powers, but what...?<wait><end>
[45]Darksol, the completion of your revival was hindered by the one you personally sealed away...<wait more><end>
[46]the Devil King, Zeon!<wait><end>
[47]Ah, I can hear the voice of Goddess Mitula...<wait><end>
[48]ZEON!!<line>Is that you sealing my powers from deep below?!<wait><end>
[49]Now, <party leader>! Throw the necklace at Darksol!<wait><end>
[4A]Ugyaa.....!<wait><end>
[4B]Darksol falls into the abyss...<wait><end>
[4C]All members have revived!<wait><end>
[4D]At last, Darksol is...<wait><end>
[4E]<party leader>, we defeated him!<wait><end>
[4F]Master Max, I... I...<wait><end>
[50]Adam wants to cry!<wait><end>
[51]Hohoho! Finally, the devil has been defeated!<wait><end>
[52]First of all, I must express my gratitude to you.<wait more><end>
[53]But the next time we meet, we are destined to fight, because I am a Devil...<wait><end>
[54]Odd Eye...<wait><end>
[55]We must never forget what happened here, not ever... ever...<wait><end>
[56]Ah, the sun is rising!<wait><end>
[57]So it is...<wait><end>

; Epilogue

[58]...and so that's what happened, King Galam.<wait><end>
[59]Splendid work, most admirable!<wait more><end>
[5A]You really are the Shining Force!<wait><end>
[5B]But, Darkol's powers are still present in this world.<wait more><end>
[5C]He's not dead... and his revival must be prevented.<wait more><end>
[5D]So, <party leader> left this sword, because its powers could offer some protection.<wait><end>
[5E]King Galam received the Chaos Breaker.<wait><end>
[5F]This is the ancient sword that Max wielded, and that I awarded you recently, is it not?<wait><end>
[60]<end> ; continues 5F
[61]That's correct, your Majesty.<line>This sword possesses the Powers of Light.<wait more><end>
[62]Please use its powers to protect against the devils' revival.<wait><end>
[63]I understand completely.<line>So, how about this?<wait more><end>
[64]Since it's said that Zeon is sealed there too, we'll place this sword in the shrine.<wait more><end>
[65]Because it possesses the protective Powers of Light, I expect it will supply extra protective strength.<wait><end>
[66]Many thanks, your Majesty.<wait><end>
[67]So, after this the sword will be placed in the ancient shrine.<wait more><end>
[68]The sword will be renamed to 'Force Blade', in honour of all you've done.<line>It's a good idea, don't you think?<wait><end>
[69]The 'Force Blade'?<line>Thank you, your Majesty, this is indeed a very happy occasion.<wait><end>
[6A]And now, my children, have you decided on a person to work together with Galam in protecting the Ground Seal?<wait><end>
[6B]<end> ; continues 6A
[6C]Yes, we all agreed that this matter should be decided by Ruburan.<wait><end>
[6D]This man is to become the King of Ground Seal.<wait more><end>
[6E]He's a more patient man than I, and far more suitable.<line>Allow me to introduce him!<wait><end>
[6F]Nosshu is honest... and what strength!<wait more><end>
[70]I mean, he travelled all the way here by himself.<wait more><end>
[71]He'll certainly become a great King, don't you agree, King Galam?<wait><end>
[72]B....but, Boss, I'm useless compared with you...<wait><end>
[73]Everyone has recommended that I make the decision, and I choose you, Nosshu.<wait more><end>
[74]I don't expect anyone would disagree that you'll make a good King, isn't that right?<wait><end>
[75]Well, if it's the decision of the Shining Force, then who am I to refuse it?<wait><end>
[76]<end> ; continues 75
[77]Yahoo!<line>It's decided, it's decided!<line>Nosshu will be the King!<wait><end>
[78]Isn't it great, Nosshu?!<wait more><end>
[79]If you hadn't shown up when we faced the Kraken, I don't know what we would have done.<wait more><end>
[7A]Nosshu... you'll really become a good King.<wait><end>
[7B]...Y... yes, boss!<wait><end>
[7C]Nosshu, congratulations on being the founder of Ground Seal!<wait more><end>
[7D]If you need help, I'll be here for you.<wait><end>
[7E]Huh?!<wait><end>
[7F]There are many things I'd like to look into, following our victory over the terrible crisis.<wait more><end>
[80]The existence of devils and the seals... the purpose of Light.<wait more><end>
[81]I'd like to investigate the value of some of these phenomenon, there's a lot to learn!<wait><end>
[82]Ah, once again we see the scholar's curiosity in Hawel!<wait more><end>
[83]Hawel, do your best!<line>Together with Nosshu you'll make a magnificent country.<wait><end>
[84]Uh-huh, Sonette, I'll do my best!<wait><end>
[85]Good....<delay 01> but everyone must try their hardest now that <party leader>, Max and Adam aren't here anymore.<wait more><end>
[86]Where did those guys go, anyway?<wait><end>
[87]You're right... where did they all go?<wait><end>
[88]Even Odd Eye fought alongside us.<wait more><end>
[89]Everyone joined together, and for the first time we really were the Shining Force...<wait><end>
[8A]But, I think I can understand more or less how <party leader> and the others must be feeling.<wait more><end>
[8B]As a man, I feel that now is the time for my own preparations... I want to travel too!<wait><end>
[8C]What?! Knuckles, you'd just sleep in late while everyone else left without you...<wait><end>
[8D]<end> ; continues 8C
[8E]I, for one, am sure they'll come back to us someday.<wait more><end>
[8F]Someday, without a doubt...<wait><end>

[90]Mephisto, this is the place where your parents sleep.<wait more><end>
[91]Take a good look at it, and remember it well...<wait><end>
[92]Waaah waaaah!<wait><end>
[93]There, there now, Mephisto. Don't cry.<wait more><end>
[94]Well, Mephisto... we must go quietly to the place where our comrades wait.<wait><end>
