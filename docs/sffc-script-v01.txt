=The Shining Force fought a long battle at the ancient temple on the continent of Parmecia.{W2}
=Adam was damaged, and so they returned to the port town of Hassan to repair him...{W1}
=How are you feeling, Adam?{N}Are the repairs working, I wonder?{W1}
=It's hopeless. I don't think I'll be able to fight anymore.{W2}
=The others will be able to fight though, they're strong enough.{N}We should set out to find Max as soon as possible.{W1}
=If you think it's necessary Adam, set up a pursuing party.{W1}
=Indeed. I must protect Master Max, and prevent the entire world from being destroyed!{W2}
=For that reason, we should leave here and try to pick up his trail.{N}Don't worry though, we'll be back.{W1}
=Adam should be doing fine now.{W2}
=When we brought him here to Hassan, I was worried he might never return to normal.{W1}
=There's no need to worry, Mead. There's a self-repairing mechanism inside me.{W2}
=I may not be completely repaired yet, but I'm not about to become a useless lump of metal!{W1}
=Nonetheless, we'll still worry a little.{N}Adam is delicate, unlike Mead!{W1}
=That's right, Paige. Who would have imagined how Adam managed to recover?!{W2}
=For an apprentice mage like Hawel, this will be the sight of a lifetime!{W1}
=What are you saying about me this time, Sonette?{W1}
=Do you really think that I'm just some useless academic?{W2}
=I've already taught you so much. What a waste of time! {W1}
=Just kidding, just kidding!{N}I've often had to depend on you and your experience, Hawel.{W1}
=Okay, is everybody here?{N}Well, let's journey to the ancient temple to see what devils we must face!{W1}
=Just a minute!{N}Shouldn't Knuckles be going with us?{W1}
=That lazybones must have slept in again. He's really let Max down this time, he doesn't deserve to come with us.{W2}
=He's always late, and we always have to wait for him. We'll be waiting all day for him to wake up and get here!{W1}
=That's right. There's no reason to let him delay us.{N}When he comes out, he can join us. Let's go now.{W1}
=Oh dear! Knuckles, what shall we do with you!{N}If he shows up, I'll tell him you've already left.{W1}
=Thank you. We couldn't ask for more.{W1}
=Well then, Elder, our group should leave for the Ancient temple now. We'll return soon.{W1}
=I'll be here waiting for you.{W1}
=Grandpa, could {LEADER} please have a word with you?{W1}
=Alright.{N}Wait inside, I'll be there in a moment.{W1}
={LEADER} became lost on his journey and came to Hassan by coincidence.{W2}
=I believe {LEADER} has something to tell Adam, too...{W2}
=...but I suppose he will have to wait until you return.{W1}
=Well then....{N}Let's go to the ancient temple!{W1}
=Hey! Wait up!{N}I'm all set to come along and do my best!{W1}
=Knuckles, it's you!{N}What in the world were you thinking, arriving so late?!{W2}
=If you hadn't got here in time, we'd be setting off for the ancient temple without you!{W1}
=Ha ha!{N}Sorry, sorry!{W2}
=I slept in late... then rushed to get ready!{N}I'm here because I know how important this is.{W1}
=Come along then, it's time to depart.{W1}
=Well everyone, let's go!{W1}
=So Adam and his companions headed for the ancient temple to search for Max's trail, however...{W1}
=This...{N}Is this it?{W1}
=It is!{N}This is the Caravan...{N}It's said to be a very convenient means of transportation.{W1}
=I... I don't understand!{N}How do you get this thing to move?{N}If we could only work out how to get inside...{W1}
=Oh well, that woman said it's okay to break it if we can't make it work.
=He's going to damage that ancient relic!{W1}
=Someone just had to come and spoil this...{N}We'll abandon the caravan for now. Let's get out of here!{W2}
=Hey, you!{N}A thief like me is skilled enough to escape. Men, why don't you keep them company?{W1}
=The enemy is coming!{W1}
=Adam, you can't fight, but we can!{W1}
=Understood. Well then Mead, please lead them!{W1}
=What?!{N}My men can't have been defeated!{W2}
=I think now's the time for a hasty exit.{W1}
=I suppose you must be one of Mishaela's minions, since you're here at the ancient temple trying to damage things.{W2}
=We can't let you go free until we have decided there is good reason to do so.{W1}
={LEADER} and the Force were now intent on heading north to Pacalon. To get there, they must pass through a cave...{W1}
=This cave is really long, isn't it?{W1}
=It's just too narrow. I'm having trouble flying in here!{W1}
=Aww, quit complaining.{N}The way out can't be too far now...{W2}
=Hey! I just felt a breeze on my skin!{W1}
=Hold on Hawel... why do you always act like you're some great know-it-all?{W1}
=Whatever. This cave is bound to come out somewhere in the region of Pacalon.{W2}
=We can take some time to have a well-deserved rest after we get out.{W1}
=What's that?!{W2}
=I think I just saw someone over there... a shadow moved.{N}This could mean danger.{W1}
=Eh?{N}We don't need that sort of thinking. It's nothing.{W1}
=No, I'm sure it was somebody.{N}Hello...? Is anyone there?{W1}
=Do you have to shout so loud?! That could be Mishaela's squad ahead of us, what shall we do?{W1}
=Hey, did I hear somebody's voice just now?{W1}
=Oooh, I heard that too!{N}Are they the ones that Master Magus is searching for?{W1}
=Alright!{N}I'll attack first!{W1}
=The cave is shaking!{W1}
=Eek! The pillars!{W1}
=It's the enemy!{N}Attack them, everyone, but be careful!{W1}
=They're still coming?{N}Then I'll try again!{W1}
=Master Magus! We've been discovered...{N}Th... they're here.... uuggghh{N}...{W1}
=It's just a matter of time until the enemy finds us...{W2}
={LEADER}, we must make haste!{W1}
=Fight!{N}If we defeat them in this battle, we can take over the city of Pacalon!{W1}
=You're too slow!{N}Why do some of the Pacalon troops still remain undefeated?!{W1}
=Well, Master Magus...{N}The Pacalon force have grouped together in resistance - we can't defeat them!{W1}
=Then they leave me no other choice...{W2}
=We'll make that river overflow! Pacalon's soldiers will have a drink of water like they've never had before!{N}Heh heh heh!{W1}
=Heh heh heh! Good, it worked.{W2}
=They soon lost their fighting spirit!{N}Now everybody, let's march into Pacalon!{W1}
=Oooh!{W1}
={LEADER}, we'll soon be reaching Pacalon, the country of centaurs.{W2}
=Over there you'll see a crowd of their splendid Knights!{W1}
=Oh no! Pacalon is under attack!{W1}
=If I'm not mistaken, that's the Devil Army!{N}{LEADER}, we must assist our allies.{W1}
=Master Magus!{N}Look over there! {LEADER} and his Force have arrived.{W1}
=Well, if we take the castle first, we can use it against {LEADER} and his soldiers!{W1}
=Ahh! It looks like our soldiers were defeated by {LEADER} yet again!{W1}
=We've got no choice.{N}Withdraw our troops and defeat {LEADER} first!{W1}
=*grunt*{N}How could this happen?{W1}
=Hehehe! What's wrong Magus?!{N}Did things not go according to plan?{W1}
=L...Lynx...?{N}Easy for you to say!{N}I'm only a step away from finishing them off.{W1}
=I find that most dubious, judging by the current situation.{W1}
=That's not fair!{W2}
=If they hadn't arrived so soon, I could have taken them as planned!{W1}
=It seems that they came here because they found you.{W1}
=Please, Lynx! I beg you to take me with you!{W1}
=...well, alright I'll help you this once.{W1}
={LEADER}, the enemy has retreated!{W1}
=I'm Sylvia, a Knight from Pacalon.{W2}
=Thanks to you our country is safe and the Devil army has departed.{W1}
=You must be {LEADER}, right?{N}I know that because we received a report from Volcanon's country, Bedoe.{W1}
=I flew to Pacalon from Bedoe when I heard about the Devil Army.{W2}
=Not everyone can fly so far without a rest, wouldn't you agree? Ha ha ha!{W1}
=So, you were the one at Bedoe with Kiddo, fighting the Devil Army...{W1}
=Ah yes, I remember that.{W2}
=I also entered the cave, and just missed the cave-in.{W2}
=So, I quickly made it through one step ahead of you to Pacalon.{W1}
=Your actions have made me think...{W2}
=I'd like to come with you all and fight to protect our world.{W1}
=I hope I'm not too late, but I also wish to join you.{W1}
=Sylvia the Knight and Julia the Birdwoman join the Force.{W1}
=Before we go on to fight, we should all take a rest in Pacalon.{W1}
=Magus, we must report to you that this man has broken Army regulations!{W1}
=Now, if I remember correctly, you're Eric. That is your name, isn't it?{W2}
=I understand you used to be a spy...{W1}
=I didn't do anything of the sort!{W1}
=Ah, Magus, you always did enjoy blaming the innocent!{W1}
=Oh, it's you again.{N}You do me an injustice, Lynx. This time I have proof.{W1}
=Really?{W1}
=Then why don't you show me this 'proof'?{W2}
=What has Eric done? And what could Eric hope to achieve?{W1}
=All I want is to see Mishaela.{W2}
=If I enter the Devil Army, one of these days I'll meet up with her. So, that's the reason for my actions.{W1}
=Wh... what?!{W1}
=Well, well!{W1}
=You two! Get him and take him for execution!{W1}
=Wait. Isn't this interesting?{W1}
=Lynx, what do you plan to do?{W1}
=You caught him by using dirty traps. I cannot accept that.{W1}
=Eric is released from his chains.{W1}
=Fight me, Eric!{W2}
=If you cannot defeat me, you do not have a chance against Mistress Mishaela!{W1}
=I'm ready anytime... c'mon!{W1}
=Everyone else, step back and don't interfere!{W1}
=Oooh!{W1}
=*gasp*{W1}
=*gasp*{W1}
=Now's our chance! Everyone, after Eric!{W1}
=You can't do that!{N}I'm leaving this place now...{W1}
=After him!{W1}
=It's a shame we have to kill a man like him.{W1}
=I wanted to defeat that man in a fair battle.{W2}
=My apologies for causing you this trouble, Magus.{W2}
=But, remember this: you should always fight fair and square!{W1}
=Lynx is so selfish. One of these days I'll get even with him.{W1}
=First, I must find Eric, otherwise I'll be in big trouble!{W1}
=Volcanon said that we should head North.{W2}
=If we carry on this way, and don't go astray, we should reach the town of Moun.{W2}
=We'll have to go via Moun to get to the far north, where he said we'll find a real treat at a place called Nazca.{W1}
=It's about time our scout Julia reported back to us.{W1}
=Those guys seem to be wandering around quite strangely, don't they?{W2}
=It seems that Magus is the commanding officer of the Devil Army's force here, and they're quite frantic right now to find a guy called Eric...{W1}
= ; continues 66
=Eric...{N}Interesting...{N}Who is that, I wonder?{W1}
=Any sign of Eric?{W1}
=No, he doesn't seem to be here.{W1}
=I don't know... he must be further away. We've gotta search well!{W1}
=Hey!{N}It's you guys again!{W1}
=Curses!{N}It seems like we'll have to fight them again!{W1}
=Hmm, did those guys make it this far to the north?{N}Put off the search for Eric, we must attack {LEADER} and his Force!{W1}
=We only just failed to catch Eric, and it's because we had to see to you first!{W2}
=And now we're disgraced! Uuggh, if Lynx hadn't gotten in my way...{W2}
={LEADER}, next time I'll do whatever it takes, remember that! Hehehe!{W1}
=Whatever it takes? What does he mean?{W2}
=Oh well, anyway...{N}As Sylvia said, we should head to the town of Moun now.{W1}
=...this is my battle plan, Lynx, and I need your assistance.{W1}
=What do you think you are doing?{N}I wanted a fairly matched battle.{W2}
=If you're going to have such unfair tactics, I can't go along with them. You need to rethink your plans, Magus.{W1}
=Hmmm.... unfair, you say?{W2}
=The only thing that matters in a battle is victory. I bet I can handle this without you anyway.{N}If you don't like the way I'm doing this, then go somewhere else.{W1}
=Are you serious, Magus?!{W2}
=Well, if you really mean it, it's not my turn anyway.{W1}
=Well, well, it's the Shining Force. I've heard rumours about you!{W1}
=You're early, we were just about to start preparing your welcome!{W1}
=Isn't the Devil Army here?{W1}
=No, the Devil Army already withdrew because they heard you were coming.{W1}
=They're bound to attack somewhere, don't you think?{W1}
=...please, won't you come into our town?{W1}
=This is a trap! Get out of there NOW!{W1}
=Hehehe, the fools actually came in!{W1}
=It's you!{W1}
=Yes it is I, Magus, commander of the Devil Army!{N}Take a look around, {LEADER}!{W1}
=You are completely surrounded.{N}Prepare to die... in the most humiliating way!{W1}
=Impossible! They defeated my troops again!{W2}
=I should have known that Lynx's absence was the fatal flaw in my plan.{W2}
=But remember this: you barely escaped with your lives!{W1}
=I should have known this was a trap...{W1}
=Hey, over here! Hurry up and open this gate!{W1}
=Thank goodness you're alright.{N}I didn't expect you to defeat the Devil Army under the circumstances.{W1}
=You're the one who Magus was pursuing?{W1}
=That's right, I'm Eric.{W1}
=I joined the Devil Army to see Mishaela. They discovered my real intentions, and took me before Magus. 
=So, why do you want to see Mishaela?{W1}
=My father, Elliot, worked for King Ramladu.{W2}
=But, the Devil Army manipulated the King, and made him a wicked man...{W1}
=My master, Max, told me of Elliot.{W2}
=He was a proud warrior.{W1}
=He knew the King was wrong, but he never betrayed his King.{W1}
=I see.{W1}
=But despite that, father should have fought against the Devil Army.{W2}

=Max?!{D2}{N}You know Master Max?{W2}
=Please, tell me more! Max is my master!{W1}

=Unfortunately he's not here to see.{W2}
=I alone remain here, to continue my training and to find a waterfall which is rumoured to have supernatural powers.{W1}
=So then, Mr. Morton, you don't know where Max is?{W1}
=Unfortunately, that's the case.{N}I only know the way Max went...{W1}
=So, where was that?{W1}
=I'll remember in a minute... don't be impatient!{W1}
=Well, I've decided I should probably go with you.{W2}
=Even though I can't remember, it has been quite some time, and we should get going!{W1}
=We must help to get justice for our brave friend.{N}After all, what have I been doing all this training for?!{W1}
=Max has probably been taken to the devil's stronghold at Ground Seal's ancient tower.{W2}

=The stronghold of Galam lies ahead of us. It was originally built to defend against monster attacks.{W2}

=Although we are Master Eiku's scouting party, we alone are enough to take them down!{W1}

=You're doing very well!{N}Since that's the case... tentacles, come out!{W1}
=Remember this... although you defeated us, you won't defeat Master Eiku in his fortress...{N}ugh...{W1}

=That's right, Eiku.{N}I suggest that you pay extra attention, and be well prepared before you face them.{W1}
=Lynx!{W1}
=Indeed.{N}How are your battle preparations progressing?{W1}
=What are you doing here!?{N}Magus died before your very eyes, and you didn't try to help him.{W2}
=If I was in the same situation, you wouldn't help me either. I will not allow this to happen.{W2}
=If those guys enter my fortress, they won't ever leave it!{W1}
=Eiku, are you saying that I allowed Magus to die?{W2}
=I suppose no matter what I say, it won't change your prejudice.{W2}

=Well, the preparations here are almost finished. It seems we should be able to do this.{W2}

=What in the world is going on lately?{N}First it's that suspicious woman, now this mechanical monster catches me!{W1}

=Eh? What?{N}I don't even know the woman's name...{W2}
=...and I can't say I'm too thrilled about being here.{W1}

=Wait just a minute!{N}That woman took my gang hostage.{W2}
=She threatened us to bring back this ancient relic... or else!{W1}
=This fellow must be a criminal, trying to steal that ancient relic. We can't allow him to go.{W2}
=What do you think we should do, Adam?{W1}
=Well, first of all we should probably return to Hassan to discuss this with the Elder.{W1}
=That's a good idea.{N}Perhaps that suspicious woman is Mishaela.{W2}

=You might as well stay here. As for this old man, we've decided to take him with us.{W2}

=It's too dangerous.{W2}
=What if something were to happen to you? If we save the Elder and you're not here to welcome him, imagine how heartbroken he'll be.{W1}
=Well, {LEADER}. Let's go now!{W1}
=But, that woman is dangerous!{N}My instincts tell me she's like a demon straight out of hell.{W1}
=As you say, Ruburan, this is indeed a dangerous journey.{N}However we have no choice but to go.{W2}
=Your men are in danger too. We can't just stand by and do nothing.{N}Please lead the way, Ruburan.{W1}
=...{D2}{N}Alright then, everybody follow me!{W1}
=This place is dangerous... it's crawling with monsters.{W2}
=They outnumber us by far... we should make this quick then hurry to my secret hideout.{W1}

=Hehehe!{N}It looks like our victims have arrived!{W2}
=Capture them all!{W1}
=Heh.{N}I absolutely hate these guys!{N}This could be dangerous...{W1}
=That was easy, wasn't it?! You all put up a great fight!{N}Any interest in becoming bandits? You'll be welcomed in my gang.{W1}
=Oh, look over there - a camp! What a relief! I suppose we should go there.{W1}
={LEADER}, let's hurry to the camp.{W1}
=Wait, {LEADER}!{N}I want to come with you!{W1}
=I.... I couldn't just stay back there doing nothing. I was so worried about Grandpa.{W2}
=In spite of what you said, I've decided I have to come with you all.{W1}
=What?! You followed us here?{N}You're just a little girl! Now go home before you get hurt.{W1}
=What you said makes sense, Ruburan. But, it's too dangerous for Cynthia to go back by herself.{W1}
=I don't think I can help much in fighting, but I can use healing magic.{W2}
=If anyone is injured, I can heal them!{W1}
=Well {LEADER}, what do you think? Should we let her accompany us?{W1}
={LEADER} gently nods his head.{W1}
=Thank you! Well then, let's hurry to Ribble Camp.{W2}
=I'm sure we'll be welcome, because a lot of people there are from Hassan too.{W1}
=Once we cross this bridge, we can get to my secret hideout. I'll lead the way again.{W1}
=Well, everyone - quickly, follow me across!{W1}
=What?!!{N}What in the world is that?{N}Something's happening!{W1}
=Ruburan, this looks dangerous.{N}Hurry! The bridge is starting to shake!{W1}
=The rumours at Ribble Camp must be true, that's the Kraken!{W1}
=It looks like we'll have some difficulty before we can cross the bridge and continue our journey.{W2}

=You did well, {LEADER}.{W2}
=Let's get to the other side while the Kraken is not attacking.{W1}

=I'll get the Kraken off your back!{W1}

=Wait right there Mishaela!{W1}
=Well, well, well... you're back, Ruburan!{N}You didn't come out just to oppose my words, did you?{W1}
=Minion of evil, your words are irrelevant.{W2}
=You tried to enslave us with sweet talk...
=I will no longer tolerate that!{W1}
=I offered to help you. Is this how you repay my generosity?{W2}
=I'm sure you know that there will be consequences for your defiance!{W1}
=Curse you!{D2}{N}I can't move!{W1}

=It's okay, Nosshu. That woman sends a chill down my spine too!{W2}
=Nevertheless, I cannot forgive her for this.{W1}

=On one occasion they appeared, and {LEADER} was there with Max.{W1}
=I see.{W1}
=I am concerned that the Devil Army has a treacherous plan involving Grans Island. Their ambition will bring panic to all the creatures of these lands.{W2}
=But their evil has already engulfed Grans Island, hence I cannot lay my hands on them.{W1}
=So... What should we do?{W1}
=You and your companions should go to Grans Island, and try to find a solution to this.{W2}
=Max is there too, it's important that you find a way to help him.{W1}
=Going to Grans Island... is that all we have to do?{W1}
=If that's the case, I'd like to come along too.{W1}
=Didn't we see you earlier...?{W1}
=Teehee! We didn't succeed earlier because we weren't prepared for such trouble.{W2}
=But I know I'll be a real asset to your team, because I can fly.{W1}
=What do you think, God Volcanon? Don't you think it's a good idea to let me go too?{W1}
=Hmm...{N}Indeed. {LEADER} has no flying allies in his party.{W1}
=Yay! Well then, please allow me to fight the Devil Army at your side. We'll fight for peace together!{W1}
=By the way, God Volcanon, how are we going to get to Grans Island?{W1}
=North, head north.{N}Head north and your path will open before you.{W1}
=This cave will begin the next stage of your journey. I will always be watching over you, {LEADER}!{W1}
=With God Volcanon's advice in mind, {LEADER} and the others must now travel to Grans Island.{W2}
=However, this is only the beginning!{W1}
=Step by step and day by day, {LEADER} and his Force draw nearer to Grans Island.{W2}
=However, following their unexpected escape, Mishaela is waiting for their arrival...{W1}
=Lynx, how are the plans to capture Max progressing?{W1}
=They're going well. If they continue as planned, we will soon have Max.{W1}
=Excellent.{N}By the way, Eiku, what became of {LEADER} and his party?{W1}
=Well... I've been informed that they were able to defeat your guards and after they reached Bedoe, Volcanon appeared to them.{W2}
=
=They have not been seen since then.{N}Magus has begun a search for them.{W1}
=So, Magus!{W1}
=Is everything going to be alright?{W1}
=Hehehe! Don't worry.{W2}
=If by any chance they should get through Pacalon, they won't survive the cunning trap I have prepared!{W1}
=Good.{N}You should go to Pacalon immediately!{W1}
=Hehehe...{N}I will... hehehe.{W1}
=By the way, what purpose will the old man from Hassan serve?{W1}
=Well, we have to let him live for now.{N}Primarily, it's about {LEADER}. Secondly, he may be withholding important information from us.{W2}
=The old man is a precious source for knowledge of the ancient relic.{W2}
=However...{W1}
=If, by any chance, {LEADER} is really the child of that man...{W2}
=I thought Max was the only enemy we would have to worry about.{W1}
=Personally, I'm delighted at the opportunity to face such a powerful enemy.{W1}
=Eiku!{N}He is not your enemy... at least, not for now.{W1}
=But, if I defeat him first, Eiku won't have a chance, hehehe!{W1}
=What are you saying, Lynx?!{N}Are you implying that I'm not able to defeat {LEADER}?!{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Did I make it too obvious?{W2}
=Oh well. What you choose to do about it is your own business.{W1}
=Enough, Lynx. Don't you have task called 'capturing Max' already?!{W1}
=Yes, m'lady! Please excuse me.{W1}
=Magus should be able to defeat {LEADER} and his team without any problems, but it's your job to make sure Eiku. If he fails then it's your turn.{W1}
= ; continues FB
=You can trust me with this task.{N}I'll bring him down, that's for sure! Just you watch me!{W1}
=Ho ho ho, Eiku!{N}Those are very promising words indeed! {W1}
={LEADER}, you're really going to have to try your best, because we're watching you!{N}Oh ho ho ho!{W1}
=A.... Adam...{W1}
=I didn't expect the new Shining Force to become so dependable!{W1}
=Master Max...{W2}
={LEADER} has guided us so far.{W1}
=So, it was you...{W2}
=I'm ashamed to say they put that mask on me when I was defeated in a fight with Lynx.{W2}
=Curses! It can't be that I had the same fate as my brother, Kane!{N}At least we've put an end to it now.{W1}
=How could this happen to both Max and Kane...{W1}
=...nevertheless, you've skilfully made it this far.{W2}
=I was afraid, but thanks to you it seems like we'll be able to go home.{W1}
=With that much power, {LEADER}, perhaps we really can stop the Devil's revival.{W2}
={LEADER}, may I too join the new Shining Force?{W1}
=That will reassure the group, {LEADER}.{N}Well, we should make haste and move on.{W1}
=This is the place of Lord Darksol's revival...{W1}
=Soon his revival will be completed.{W2}
=At that time, anyone who stands in his way will be powerless against him!{W2}
=Until then, {LEADER} and his force must not be allowed anywhere near Lord Darksol.{W1}
=Mistress Mishaela, even if Max is defeated, those guys pose no threat for you.{W1}
= ; continues 11
=Well, I won't be defeated!{W2}
=But, I think {LEADER} will give us more trouble than Max did.{W2}
=If by some chance they make it here, you must fight with all your strength!{W1}
={LEADER} being more troublesome than Max...?{W1}
=You should not take {LEADER} so lightly. He's a talented man, and will require extra attention when we deal with him...{W1}
=Don't think you know {LEADER} so well, Mishaela!{W1}
=It can't be...!{N}How did those guys get here?!{W1}
=Thanks to {LEADER}, I've been able to return to my old self.{W2}
=I'm sure you don't see how sweet {LEADER} is!{W1}
=*guffaws*{N}Well, well, well... isn't this a surprise?!{N}It seems there's something you don't know about {LEADER} yet, Max.{W2}
=20 years ago a prophet in Manarina gave your brother Kane a prediction...{W1}
=What?!{W1}
=That prediction spoke of our reviving Lord Darksol, at this very place.{W2}
=Kane didn't like the thought of that. He had a son, and sent him away to defeat Lord Darksol.{W2}
=...{D1}{N}and that son was...{D2} {LEADER}!{W1}
=What the...?!{W1}
=Kane raised his son to lead a Shining Force, just like you - his brother - led the Shining Force.{W2}
=His son was to follow in your footsteps.{W1}
={LEADER}, you...{W2}
=...are my older brother's son?!{W1}
=I found out about this through Hassan's Elder, and I was surprised too!{W2}
=Such a thing just can't be, can it?!{W1}
=Lord Darksol's revival is almost complete! Oh ho ho ho!{W2}
=This time, without a doubt, you fools shall not hinder the realisation of our great dream!{W1}
= ; continues 2A
=Mishaela, you can't do that!{W2}
=I can't allow you to use Lord Zeon's power in the revival of Darksol.{W1}
=W... who's that?!{W1}
=Y... you're Odd Eye!{W2}
=You're a devil, just like me. How could you have sided with those guys?{W2}
=You can try to hinder us all you like, but it will do no good.{N}I'll risk my life to see Lord Darksol revive completely!{W1}
=Mishaela, you need to wake up!{N}Why are you going so far?{W2}
=You're just dazzled by Darksol's illusions.{W2}
=You're putting your life on the line here... will that do you any good?!{W1}
=We must protect Lord Darksol's dear child, Mephisto!{W2}
=Compared with that goal, my life isn't important.{W1}
={LEADER}! If it's like this, one man alone cannot defeat Mishaela.{W2}
=Darksol's revival must be stopped! I'll join your party.{W1}
=Odd Eye the Devil has joined the Force.{W1}
=It seems I've been defeated, my magical powers are exhausted...{W2}
=I must cast away this life for...{D2}{N}At least...{W2}
=I'll sacrifice myself for you, Lord Darksol!{W1}
=Mishaela sacrificed her life for Darksol's revival...{W1}
=Mishaela's life has completed the revival of my powers.{W2}
=Now, take a good look at the true form of Darksol, King of the Devils!{W1}
=L...look over there everyone! Darksol seems to have completed his revival.{W2}
=Prepare yourselves to defeat him!{W1}
=It can't be!{N}Mere mortals can't have defeated me like this!{W2}
=My revival should have been completed...{N}How...?{W2}
=Something has been holding back my powers, but what...?{W1}
=Darksol, the completion of your revival was hindered by the one you personally sealed away...{W2}
=the Devil King, Zeon!{W1}
=Ah, I can hear the voice of Goddess Mitula...{W1}
=ZEON!!{N}Is that you sealing my powers from deep below?!{W1}
=Now, {LEADER}! Throw the necklace at Darksol!{W1}
=Ugyaa.....!{W1}
=Darksol falls into the abyss...{W1}
=All members have revived!{W1}
=At last, Darksol is...{W1}
={LEADER}, we defeated him!{W1}
=Master Max, I... I...{W1}
=Adam wants to cry!{W1}
=Hohoho! Finally, the devil has been defeated!{W1}
=First of all, I must express my gratitude to you.{W2}
=But the next time we meet, we are destined to fight, because I am a Devil...{W1}
=Odd Eye...{W1}
=We must never forget what happened here, not ever... ever...{W1}
=Ah, the sun is rising!{W1}
=So it is...{W1}
=...and so that's what happened, King Galam.{W1}
=Splendid work, most admirable!{W2}
=You really are the Shining Force!{W1}
=But, Darkol's powers are still present in this world.{W2}
=He's not dead... and his revival must be prevented.{W2}
=So, {LEADER} left this sword, because its powers could offer some protection.{W1}
=King Galam received the Chaos Breaker.{W1}
=This is the ancient sword that Max wielded, and that I awarded you recently, is it not?{W1}
= ; continues 5F
=That's correct, your Majesty.{N}This sword possesses the Powers of Light.{W2}
=Please use its powers to protect against the devils' revival.{W1}
=I understand completely.{N}So, how about this?{W2}
=Since it's said that Zeon is sealed there too, we'll place this sword in the shrine.{W2}
=Because it possesses the protective Powers of Light, I expect it will supply extra protective strength.{W1}
=Many thanks, your Majesty.{W1}
=So, after this the sword will be placed in the ancient shrine.{W2}
=The sword will be renamed to 'Force Blade', in honour of all you've done.{N}It's a good idea, don't you think?{W1}
=The 'Force Blade'?{N}Thank you, your Majesty, this is indeed a very happy occasion.{W1}
=And now, my children, have you decided on a person to work together with Galam in protecting the Ground Seal?{W1}
= ; continues 6A
=Yes, we all agreed that this matter should be decided by Ruburan.{W1}
=This man is to become the King of Ground Seal.{W2}
=He's a more patient man than I, and far more suitable.{N}Allow me to introduce him!{W1}
=Nosshu is honest... and what strength!{W2}
=I mean, he travelled all the way here by himself.{W2}
=He'll certainly become a great King, don't you agree, King Galam?{W1}
=B....but, Boss, I'm useless compared with you...{W1}
=Everyone has recommended that I make the decision, and I choose you, Nosshu.{W2}
=I don't expect anyone would disagree that you'll make a good King, isn't that right?{W1}
=Well, if it's the decision of the Shining Force, then who am I to refuse it?{W1}
= ; continues 75
=Yahoo!{N}It's decided, it's decided!{N}Nosshu will be the King!{W1}
=Isn't it great, Nosshu?!{W2}
=If you hadn't shown up when we faced the Kraken, I don't know what we would have done.{W2}
=Nosshu... you'll really become a good King.{W1}
=...Y... yes, boss!{W1}
=Nosshu, congratulations on being the founder of Ground Seal!{W2}
=If you need help, I'll be here for you.{W1}
=Huh?!{W1}
=There are many things I'd like to look into, following our victory over the terrible crisis.{W2}
=The existence of devils and the seals... the purpose of Light.{W2}
=I'd like to investigate the value of some of these phenomenon, there's a lot to learn!{W1}
=Ah, once again we see the scholar's curiosity in Hawel!{W2}
=Hawel, do your best!{N}Together with Nosshu you'll make a magnificent country.{W1}
=Uh-huh, Sonette, I'll do my best!{W1}
=Good....{D1} but everyone must try their hardest now that {LEADER}, Max and Adam aren't here anymore.{W2}
=Where did those guys go, anyway?{W1}
=You're right... where did they all go?{W1}
=Even Odd Eye fought alongside us.{W2}
=Everyone joined together, and for the first time we really were the Shining Force...{W1}
=But, I think I can understand more or less how {LEADER} and the others must be feeling.{W2}
=As a man, I feel that now is the time for my own preparations... I want to travel too!{W1}
=What?! Knuckles, you'd just sleep in late while everyone else left without you...{W1}
= ; continues 8C
=I, for one, am sure they'll come back to us someday.{W2}
=Someday, without a doubt...{W1}
=Mephisto, this is the place where your parents sleep.{W2}
=Take a good look at it, and remember it well...{W1}
=Waaah waaaah!{W1}
=There, there now, Mephisto. Don't cry.{W2}
=Well, Mephisto... we must go quietly to the place where our comrades wait.{W1}
